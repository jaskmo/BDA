    "The introduction to Bayesian logistic regression is from a [CRAN vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstanarm/vignettes/binomial.html) by Jonah Gabry and Ben Goodrich. CRAN vignette was modified to a [R notebook](https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_R_demos/blob/master/demos_rstan/diabetes.Rmd) by Aki Vehtari.  Instead of wells data in CRAN vignette, Pima Indians data is used. The end of the notebook differs significantly from the CRAN vignette.  The R notebook was ported to this Python notebook by Aki Vehtari and Tuomas Sivula."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This vignette explains how to estimate generalized linear models (GLMs) for binary (Bernoulli) response variables using PyStan.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four steps of a Bayesian analysis are\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Specify a joint distribution for the outcome(s) and all the unknowns, which typically takes the form of a marginal prior distribution for the unknowns multiplied by a likelihood for the outcome(s) conditional on the unknowns. This joint distribution is proportional to a posterior distribution of the unknowns conditional on the observed data\n",
    "2. Draw from posterior distribution using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).\n",
    "3. Evaluate how well the model fits the data and possibly revise the model.\n",
    "4. Draw from the posterior predictive distribution of the outcome(s) given interesting values of the predictors in order to visualize how a manipulation of a predictor affects (a function of) the outcome(s).\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates Steps 1-3 when the likelihood is the product of conditionally independent binomial distributions (possibly with only one trial per observation).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "For a binomial GLM the likelihood for one observation $y$ can be written as a conditionally binomial PMF $$\\binom{n}{y} \\pi^{y} (1 - \\pi)^{n - y},$$ where $n$ is the known number of trials, $\\pi = g^{-1}(\\eta)$ is the probability of success and $\\eta = \\alpha + \\mathbf{x}^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is a linear predictor. For a sample of size $N$, the likelihood of the entire sample is the product of $N$ individual likelihood contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because $\\pi$ is a probability, for a binomial model the link function $g$ maps between the unit interval (the support of $\\pi$) and the set of all real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$. When applied to a linear predictor $\\eta$ with values in $\\mathbb{R}$, the inverse link function $g^{-1}(\\eta)$ therefore returns a valid probability between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two most common link functions used for binomial GLMs are the logit and probit functions. With the logit (or log-odds) link function $g(x) = \\ln{\\left(\\frac{x}{1-x}\\right)}$, the likelihood for a single observation becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\binom{n}{y}\\left(\\text{logit}^{-1}(\\eta)\\right)^y \\left(1 - \\text{logit}^{-1}(\\eta)\\right)^{n-y} = \\binom{n}{y} \\left(\\frac{e^{\\eta}}{1 + e^{\\eta}}\\right)^{y} \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + e^{\\eta}}\\right)^{n - y}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the probit link function $g(x) = \\Phi^{-1}(x)$ yields the likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\binom{n}{y} \\left(\\Phi(\\eta)\\right)^{y} \\left(1 - \\Phi(\\eta)\\right)^{n - y},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Phi$ is the CDF of the standard normal distribution. The differences between the logit and probit functions are minor and -- if, as rstanarm does by default, the probit is scaled so its slope at the origin matches the logit's -- the two link functions should yield similar results. Unless the user has a specific reason to prefer the probit link, we recommend the logit simply because it will be slightly faster and more numerically stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, there are infinitely many possible link functions, although in practice only a few are typically used. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Priors\n",
    "\n",
    "A full Bayesian analysis requires specifying prior distributions $f(\\alpha)$ and $f(\\boldsymbol{\\beta})$ for the intercept and vector of regression coefficients. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, suppose we have $K$ predictors and believe --- prior to seeing the data --- that $\\alpha, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_K$ are as likely to be positive as they are to be negative, but are highly unlikely to be far from zero. These beliefs can be represented by normal distributions with mean zero and a small scale (standard deviation).\n",
    "\n",
    "If, on the other hand, we have less a priori confidence that the parameters will be close to zero then we could use a larger scale for the normal distribution and/or a distribution with heavier tails than the normal like the Student's $t$ distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Posterior\n",
    "\n",
    "With independent prior distributions, the joint posterior distribution for $\\alpha$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is proportional to the product of the priors and the $N$ likelihood contributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f\\left(\\alpha,\\boldsymbol{\\beta} | \\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{X}\\right) \\propto f\\left(\\alpha\\right) \\times \\prod_{k=1}^K f\\left(\\beta_k\\right) \\times \\prod_{i=1}^N { g^{-1}\\left(\\eta_i\\right)^{y_i} \\left(1 - g^{-1}\\left(\\eta_i\\right)\\right)^{n_i-y_i}}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is posterior distribution that PyStan will draw from when using MCMC."
